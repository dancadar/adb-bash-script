# adb-bash-script
The script will ask the user on which device he wants to use "adb" command if there are multiple devices connected to the PC.

Installation: just copy the script wherever you like to keep your scripts (I use ~/bin for that) as long as it's in $PATH
and make sure it's executable. Also, an alias in ~/.bashrc might be usefull ;)
